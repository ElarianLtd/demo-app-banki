# Banki

> **Important**: This app is for demonstration purposes only


## Scenario

Imagine you're a bank... You want to expose your services via USSD and ATM. You also want to run an SMS survey on your USSD/ATM users.

This simple app runs both your USSD, SMS and ATM features all with just about 250 lines of java code. No database or complex logic - thanks to Elarian!


### Install and Run

```sh
./gradlew build
./gradlew run # watch out for environment variables :)
```
